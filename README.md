#  WishFish - VandyHacks 2018 Hackathon Project

An app to help people with immediate needs (transportation, food, etc.) to be connected with givers to help them
meet those needs in a safe, anonymous transaction of receipts, gift card codes, and other means of giving. Built on a team of 4 developers in one weekend for VandyHacks 2018 at Vanderbilt University.

Our Stack: Ionic (Angular 5), Node.js Express Server, HTML/CSS/JS, MySql (Sequelize controllers)
We made use of the Google Cloud Platform API to geolocate users to recommend nearby locations from which to request goods.

Winner of the Dollar General sponsorship prize for best social hack.
